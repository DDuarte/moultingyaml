# MoultingYAML

MoultingYAML is a Scala wrapper for [SnakeYAML][snakeyaml] based on
[spray-json][spray-json].

Its basic idea is to provide a simple immutable model of the [YAML][yaml]
language, built on top of SnakeYAML models, as well as a type-class based
serialization and deserialization of custom objects.
